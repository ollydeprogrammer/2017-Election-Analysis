This repository is for a Data Analysis Project on a 2017 UK General Election Data Set. With a background in Public Policy, I love data, research and political polling. So, I decided that I would do my first major analysis on this topic. 

This project is to demonstrate my understanding of Data Analysis Using SQL (Complex Queries, Window Functions, CTE's)  and Visualisation software (Tablaeu). 

I am completely self taught in programming, with experience in preivous roles at Guinness World Records. I love it, and want to do this forever, and thats why I'm working hard to showcase my passion.
